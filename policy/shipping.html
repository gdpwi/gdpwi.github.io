		  <h5 align="center"><b>SHIPPING POLICY</b></h5>
				 
		  <div style="text-align:justify;">
				<b>Shipping Area</b><br/>
				G.D.P delivers to all locations within the geographical boundary of India. We do not deliver to International locations
				at this time but will soon be able to fulfill all such orders with advance payment options and respective Custom Duties
				and taxes of other countries.

				<br/><br/><b>Shipping Methods</b><br/>
				G.D.P dispatches all parcels using FedEx as its chosen courier partner to offer you fast and reliable delivery. You can
				track your delivery via the My Account section or by logging to our courier partner’s website.

				<br/><br/><b>Charges</b><br/>
				For deliveries within India, charges will vary on different variables depending on your parcel’s location, weight, volume
				and the value of your order. The charges include fulfillment costs of your order. A flat rate of Rs.__  will be charged for
				Cash on Delivery excluding different variables such as parcel’s location, weight, volume and value.

				<br/><br/><b>Cash On Delivery</b><br/>
				Cash on delivery option is available only in India and for amounts less than Rs. 1---- If the chosen mode of payment is cash
				on delivery, a variable convenience charge will apply including Rs. -- flat charges for such orders. You can view the delivery
				charges at the time of payment. These are over and above the selling price of the product. You can also view the delivery charges
				in the invoice or My order section.

				<br/><br/><b>Delivery Times</b><br/>
				The goods will be delivered within 3-5 working days from the date of dispatch for all deliveries within India and Estimated delivery
				times are available from the moment you place your order. In the My Account section, you can view the dispatch date of your parcel 
				(available once your parcel has left our warehouses) Once your parcel has been dispatched by our Logistics team, an email will
				automatically be sent to you.

				<br/><br/><b>Delivery Problems</b><br/>
				Despite our best efforts and those of our courier partner, certain issues can arise before your parcel is delivered. In order to
				guarantee you seamless service quality, G.D.P promises to do its best to find the causes and resolve the problem in a timely manner.

				<br/><br/><b>Track Order Online</b><br/>
				Once your parcel has been dispatched, an email containing your parcel information is sent to you automatically. You can then follow
				your parcel’s progress on our website by going to the My Account / My orders section. If you are unable to view any information
				regarding your parcel, we recommend that you contact us so we can follow up on your order at G.D.P or call us at our customer care
				numbers or by logging to our courier partner’s website.

				<br/><br/><b>What if I am not available at the time of delivery?</b><br/>
				Should you not be present when our courier attempts to deliver your parcel, a message/call will be left for your information. 
				If your neighbour/help/driver/family member has accepted it on your behalf, the delivery will be considered ‘Delivered’. 
				However, a second attempt will automatically be made after 48 hour if no one was present at the given address.
				After the second attempt, our courier will hold on to your parcel for 7 days awaiting further instructions from the 
				recipient before returning your parcel togdp. Once the parcel has been sent back to us, you must wait until it arrives
				in our warehouse. We will re-dispatch it to you as per your instructions. You will have to bear re-delivery charges which 
				may vary from the charges in your actual order price.

				<br/><br/><b>Damaged Parcel</b><br/>
				When you receive your parcel, you notice that it is damaged you should refuse to accept it. 
				All parcels are guaranteed to be in perfect condition when they are dispatched from our warehouse,
				complete with security tape that should be visible and intact. Send us an e-mail at G.D.P stating that 
				you have refused to accept the damaged parcel within 3 days of receiving the parcel. Please send us the parcel.
				It should reach us within 7 days. Incase we don’t have stock at that point in time we will issue a credit note for the amount paid.

				<br/><br/><b>What to do if a damaged parcel has been delivered?</b><br/>
				If your parcel was left for you in your post-box, or if your neighbour/help/driver/family member has accepted 
				it on your behalf, and it is damaged, the parcel is considered ‘Accepted’. If on opening your parcel you notice 
				that items are damaged or missing, please inform us within 3 days of receiving the parcel by sending an e-mail at G.D.P.
				For further information on returns kindly visit our return policy.
				Please be aware that your order may be dispatched in separate parcels and on different dates due to several reasons like out of stock items,
				custom orders etc. If you have only received a part of your order, we recommend you visit the delivery tracking page in the My Account / 
				My orders section. If shipment is still ongoing, your missing items will certainly be delivered shortly. If the shipment dates have lapsed
				and you have not received your entire order, please contact us by sending a mail to customer care at G.D.P.
